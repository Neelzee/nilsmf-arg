# Hello!

I'm Nils Michael, a master's student at the University of Bergen, pursuing my degree in Software Engineering.

## About Me

- **Passionate Programmer**: I have a strong interest in software development and have experience with multiple programming languages, including Rust, Haskell, JavaScript, Java, Python, and C/C++. My favourite being Rust and Haskell.

I've made several minor projects in both, including a prototype [terminal card game engine](https://github.com/Neelzee/CardEngine), in Haskell, and a [horror platformer](https://github.com/MikalDr/GameJamFall2023), in Rust, for a game jam competition, which won!

- **Game Development**: I collaborate with friends on game development projects, and we publish our games on itch.io under [404 Game Not Found](https://game-not-found.itch.io/). Most of our games have been developed for game jams, but we hope to develop larger and more interesting games in the future!

- **Education**: I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Technology at UIB and am currently a first-year master's student at the University of Bergen.
