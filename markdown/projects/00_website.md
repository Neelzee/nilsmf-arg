# Website Application

My personal website is built with a combination of technologies to ensure a robust and responsive user experience.

## Backend

- **Rust Backend**: The server-side of the application is powered by Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance and safety.

- **Actix Web Framework**: To create a high-performance and asynchronous web server, I used Actix, a powerful Rust web framework. It allows for efficient handling of HTTP requests and routing.

## Frontend

- **React with TypeScript**: For the client-side, I chose React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The use of TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability by adding static typing.

The combination of Rust on the server and React with TypeScript on the client ensures a fast and reliable website that delivers a seamless experience to its users.
