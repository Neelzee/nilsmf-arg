# About Me

I'm Nils Michael ðŸ¤ , and I am 22 years old, and I like programming. I prefer anything but the frontend (you could probably guess that), but I am a fullstack dev.


I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Bergen. My thesis is making an IDE, for a programming language designed at UIB.

## Programming Languages

My favorite programming languages include Rust and Haskell, but I'm well-versed in a range of languages, including JavaScript, Java, Python, and C/C++. But I prefer languages aimed at functional programming (ðŸ¤“).

### Projects

- Rust

  - [This](projects/backend) application.
  - An [IOT-Emulator](https://github.com/Haugalandet/VAL-IOT), for a school project
  - A [Webscraper](https://github.com/Neelzee/archive-mn), for archiving an old website
  - [Card Game Engine](https://github.com/Neelzee/RCardEngine), rewritten in Rust

- Haskell

  - A [Card Game Engine](https://github.com/Neelzee/CardEngine)

- Java

  - A [game](https://github.com/Neelzee/KurtMario) made using [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/)
  - [VAL](https://github.com/Haugalandet), a voting application I made with friends.

## Game Development

I have a deep passion for game development and often collaborate with friends on projects. Our games are published on itch.io under [404 Game Not Found](https://game-not-found.itch.io/). Many of our games are developed under game jams, so there is room for improvement.
We hope to be able to improve, and have more time to create better games in the future.
