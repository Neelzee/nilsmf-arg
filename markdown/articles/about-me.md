# About Me

I'm Nils Michael, a dedicated and enthusiastic software engineering master's student with a passion for technology and a commitment to innovation. Here's a more in-depth look at my background and interests:

## Education

I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Software Engineering at the University of Bergen. Additionally, I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Technology from UIB.

## Programming Languages

My favorite programming languages include Rust and Haskell, but I'm well-versed in a range of languages, including JavaScript, Java, Python, and C/C++.

## Current Employment

I am currently working for UIB at Medienorge as an IT Consultant. In this role, I serve as a full-stack developer responsible for managing the content visible to the public, as well as developing and managing the tools used to create this content. The project leverages ColdFusion, which provides a unique set of challenges and learning opportunities. As the sole developer, I have the freedom to experiment and learn from my mistakes. While I prefer working in teams, I enjoy the responsibility and autonomy this role provides.

## Game Development

I have a deep passion for game development and often collaborate with friends on projects. Our games are published on itch.io under "404 Game Not Found" (GNF). Many of our games are developed under the label "GameJames," although we acknowledge there is room for improvement in terms of code quality and gameplay. We hope to invest more time in the future to create larger and more engaging games. Additionally, I'm currently working on a website for GNF to showcase our creations.

I'm a dedicated individual constantly seeking new opportunities and challenges in the field of software engineering. Whether it's contributing to open-source [projects](https://github.com/Bergen-CCCP), experimenting with new technologies, or developing innovative solutions, I'm always eager to learn and grow in this dynamic field.
